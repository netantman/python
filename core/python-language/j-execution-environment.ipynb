    "### Interpreter Options and Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- The interpreter has **a number of options** that control its runtime behavior and environment. Options are given to the interpreter on the command line: `python [options] [-c cmd | filename | - ] [args]`. Some usual options are as follows.\n",
    "    - The `-i` option starts an interactive session immediately after a program has finished execution and is useful for debugging.\n",
    "    - The `-m` option runs a library module as a script which executes inside the `__main__` module prior to the execution of the main script.\n",
    "    - The `-O` and `-OO` options apply some optimization to byte-compiled files \n",
    "- Command-line options appearing after the program name or hyphen (`-`) are passed to the program in `sys.argv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The interpreter reads the following **environment variables**\n",
    "    - `PYTHONPATH` specifies a module search path that is inserted into the beginning of `sys.path`.\n",
    "    - `PYTHONSTARTUP` specifies a file to execute when the interpreter runs in interactive mode; see below.\n",
    "    - The `PYTHONHOME` variable is used to set the location of the Python installation but is rarely needed because Python knows how to find its own libraries and the site-packages directory where extensions are normally installed.\n",
    "        - If a single directory is given, the interpreter **expects to find all files in that location**.\n",
    "        - If two directories are given, the interpreter searches for **platform-independent files in the first directory and platform-dependent files in the second**.\n",
    "    - The `PYTHONIOENCODING` environment setting might be of interest to users of Python 3 because it sets both the encoding and error handling of the standard I/O streams."

    "### Interactive Sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "- If no program name is given and the standard input to the interpreter is an interactive terminal, Python starts in interactive mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The interpreter evaluates the script contained in the `PYTHONSTARTUP` environment variable (if set). \n",
    "    - This script is evaluated as if it’s part of the input program (that is, it isn’t loaded using an `import` statement).\n",
    "    - One application of this script might be to read a user configuration file such as `.pythonrc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In customized applications, you can **change the prompts** by modifying the values of `sys.ps1` and `sys.ps2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, the output of commands issued in interactive mode is generated by printing the output of the built-in `repr()` function on the result. This can be **changed by setting the variable `sys.displayhook` to a function responsible for displaying results**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, in interactive mode, it is useful to know that the **result of the last operation** is stored in a special variable (`_`). This variable can be used to retrieve the result should you need to use it in subsequent operations. "

    "\n",
    "- For each directory in the list, a check is made to see whether the directory exists. If so, it’s added to the `sys.path` variable. Next, a check is made to see whether it contains any **path configuration files** (files with a `.pth` suffix). A path configuration file contains a list of directories, `zip` files relative to the location of the path file that should be added to `sys.path`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each directory in the path configuration file must be listed on a separate line. Comments and blank lines are ignored. When the site module loads the file, it checks to see whether each directory exists. If so, the directory is added to `sys.path`. Duplicated items are added to the path only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After all paths have been added to `sys.path`, an attempt is made to import a module named `sitecustomize`. The purpose of this module is to perform any additional (and arbitrary) site customization: lacking details on how it can be done."
