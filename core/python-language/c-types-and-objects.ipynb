    "### Object Identity and Type\n",
    "- The built-in function **`id()`** returns the identity of an object as an integer. This integer usually corresponds to the object’s location in memory, although this is specific to the Python implementation and no such interpretation of the identity should be made.\n",
    "- The built-in function **type()** returns the type of an object.\n",
    "- Notes on **type checking**\n",
    "    - The **`is`** operator compares the identity of two objects: all type objects are assigned names that can be used to perform type checking.\n",
    "    - Because the `isinstance()` function is aware of inheritance, it is the preferred way to check the type of any Python object."

    "### Reference Counting and Garbage Collection\n",
    "- All objects are **reference-counted (ref-count)**. \n",
    "    - An object’s reference count is increased whenever it’s assigned to a new name or placed in a container.\n",
    "    - An object’s reference count is decreased by the `del` statement or whenever a reference goes out of scope (or is reassigned).\n",
    "    - The current reference count of an object can be obtained using the `sys.getrefcount()` function. In many cases, the reference count **is much higher** than you might guess. For **immutable data** such as numbers and strings, the interpreter **aggressively shares objects** between different parts of the program in order to **conserve memory**.\n",
    "- The `gc` module provides an interface for controlling the garbage collector used to collect cycles in objects.\n",
    "    - As various types of container objects are created, they're placed on a **list that's internal to the interpreter**. Whenever container objects are deallocated, they’re removed from this list.\n",
    "    - If the **number of allocations exceeds the number of deallocations by a user-definable threshold value**, the garbage collector is invoked. The garbage collector works by scanning this list and identifying collections of objects that are no longer being used but haven't been deallocated due to circular dependencies.\n",
    "    - The garbage collector uses a **three-level generational scheme** in which objects that survive the initial garbage-collection step are placed onto lists of objects that are checked less frequently. This provides better performance for programs that have a large number of long-lived objects.\n",
    "    - In this [article](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s191/nl/21353936/00bf6b41-63fa-4e2e-afc8-b9243b8ae313?title=Python%20Garbage%20Collection:%20What%20It%20Is%20and%20How%20It%20Works), it is recommended not to tamper with the default setting of `gc` light-heartedly."

In particular, an instance of a class can emulate a function if it defines a special method, `__call__()`. If this method is defined for an instance, `x`, then\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Methods** (`types.MethodType`) are functions that are defined inside a class defintion. Besides `__doc__`, `__name__`, it also has these other aatributes: `__class__`, `__func__` and `__self__`.\n",
    "    - A **bound method** is a callable object that wraps both a function (the method) and an associated instance.\n",
    "    - An **unbound method** is a callable object that wraps the method function, but which expects an instance of the proper type to be passed as the first argument. It is **removed in Python3**.\n",

However, if a user-defined class uses `__slots__`, a more efficient internal representation is used and instances will not have a `__dict__` attribute; see this [notebook](g-classes-and-object-oriented-programming.ipynb) for more details.\n",
