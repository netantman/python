    "\n",
    "- Python programs are executed by an **interpreter**. Usually, the interpreter is started by simply typing `python` into a command shell. However, there are many different implementations of the interpreter and Python development environments (for example, Jython, IronPython, IDLE,ActivePython,Wing IDE, pydev, etc.), so you should consult the documentation for startup details.\n",
    "- Python’s **interactive mode** is one of its most useful features. In the interactive shell, you can type any valid statement or sequence of statements and immediately view the results. When you use Python interactively, the special variable `_` holds the result of the last operation.\n",
    "- To **execute the `py` file**, you provide the filename to the interpreter: there can be different versions if you have multiple `python` installed. On `UNIX`, you can use #! on the first line of the program, like this: \n",
    "\n",

    "- The assignment `=` operator simply creates **an association between a name and a value**. \n",
    "    - Although each value has an associated type such as an integer or string, variable names are untyped and can be made to refer to any type of data during execution. To be precise, it is not the type that the variable has changed, but rather the value (object) to which the variable refers to has changed. \n",
    "    - This is different from `C`, for example, in which a name represents a fixed type, size, and location in memory into which a value is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A newline terminates each statement. However, you can use a semicolon `;` to separate statements on the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing complex test cases commonly results in statements that involve an annoyingly long line of code. To improve readability, you can continue any statement to the next line by using a backslash (`\\`) at the end of a line as shown. If you do this, the normal indentation rules don’t apply to the next line, so you are free to format the continued lines as you wish. But you don't need the line-continuation character when defining a triple-quoted `str`, `list`, `tuple` or `dict`: they can naturally span multiple lines."
